        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m an aspiring web developer who loves everything about coding. After college, I was an accountant for seven years but felt dissatisfied and unfulfilled. A colleague of mine introduced me to the world of coding, and it lit a fire in me. I couldn't get enough and spent my non-work hours studying. Finding Treehouse was a defining moment in my life. It helped organize my studying, and it finally paid off! I got my first job as a web developer and was able to quit my accounting job and will never look back.
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy swimming, scrapbooking, reading, and playing with my adorable niece.</p>
